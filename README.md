# Monkey Programming Language Interpreter

This project is written by following the [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) book.

It demonstrates:

- How to build an interpreter for a C-like programming language from scratch
- What a **lexer**, a **parser**, and an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** are, and how to build your own
- What **closures** are and how and why they work
- What the **Pratt parsing technique** and a **recursive descent parser** is
- What others talk about when they talk about **built-in data structures**
- What **REPL** stands for and how to build one
